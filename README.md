# attendo
JavaScript program to organize and keep track of submitting attendance forms during the e-learning era.

During the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, students at my high school were requierd to submit daily Google Forms to mark our attendance. With multiple classes, and thus multiple similar forms, I was often confused on which classes I submitted attendance for and which ones I did not.

Created a program to ensure all forms were submitted by indicating which class' form links I visited.
